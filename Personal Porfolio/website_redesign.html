				<h2>Creative Brief</h2>
				<p>This is my groups' creative brief for the website redesign. We had to come up with a variety of possible things we could change for J.Gilligans' website. We looked at possible competitors, strengths and weaknesses. The other things that were analyzed were things like salary and how much disposable income the clientele had so that the prices could accurately reflect that.</p>

				<h2>Skills Used and Why</h2>
				<p>My group all had to use various skills to complete this project. It took knowledge of things like wireframing, coding, and analytics to do well. When writing out the creative brief we had to research J.Gilligans to see their location, what kind of clientele they had. The price range of the clientele. Peak hours of operation and more. When wireframing our site we needed knowledge of wirframing programs such as XD to create mockups for our new site. We also created components using various principles that we learned in CTEC 3350. We did this to see what some optimal layouts were and how we would go about creating them later in our coding software.</p>
