			<h2>Biography</h2><img alt="tablet with the word biography on it" src="images/biography.jpg"></div>
			<div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-8 col-xl-8">
				<p>I was born in Fort Worth. My parents immigrated here from Mexico before I was born. I have 4 siblings. Two older sisters and one younger sister. One older brother. When i was young I was always outdoors and running around. My family struggled for a couple of years when I was young. I am extremely thankful to my father for everything he did to make my life the best it could be. I am now working on paying him back. I want to succeed so that my father no longer has to stress.Growing up I did not know what i wanted to do. I had aspirations of being a doctor but my mind quickly turned away from that. When I graduated high school I had to decide something I could do once I got into college. I was undecided until it came time to declare a major. I enjoy technology and ever since i wazs little i liked writing. I came to comm tech to merge those two interests.</p>
